# Supersaas Essentials (Single User variant)

This is a single user version of the Supersaas Starter Kit (original repo [here](https://github.com/SupersaasHQ/essentials-v3)).

This version does not include the teams feature, orgs, member invirations etc, while maintaining all the other features from the original. This version will stay up-to-date with any new improvements made to the main repo.

Note: I decided to keep this as a separate repo rather than a branch to avoid a messy commit history and merge conflicts. This will keep things nice and tidy!

Here's what I have completed so far:

✅ Pages, Components, UI and layouts
✅ Database setup  
✅ Authentication
✅ API Routes
✅ Image Upload
✅ CRUD app demo (posts)

Coming soon:
⏳ Account settings page
⏳ Payments
⏳ Super Admin
