### Supersaas Demo

This demo application showcases the capabilities of Supersaas - a comprehensive Nuxt 3 starter kit available at https://github.com/supersaasHQ/essentials-v3/

I've created a standalone demo app to keep the core starter kit lean and focused. While this demo provides a practical reference implementation that demonstrates best practices and recommended usage patterns. 

Here you'll find real-world examples of how to effectively leverage the template's features and architecture.

So, I will be making a few apps here

- AI Chat App
- An AI image generator with Fal.ai
- A link shortner
- Websockets implementation
- Product analytics using some third party services
- Maybe some realtime stuff like Notifications
